We have divided our app functionalities into three major sections: the relationship profiles that a user can work on individually to fill in details about loved ones, occasion planning that allows one or multiple users to organize notes and assign tasks, and the suggestion engine that is powered by AI to help give ideas for gifts and activities. We decided for our alpha MVP to focus on the first section, creating a functional app that one user can exploit and that could be used to test the baseline functionalities (logging in, storing information about relationships, etc). The log-in/sign-in and the functionality of the relationship profiles section are working now seamlessly. The backend for the MemoryGallery has been initialized, though. We realized we wanted to refine it a bit more and integrate Google Cloud Storage, so we decided to hold off on the frontend until the beta submission. Nevertheless, we're on a great track as we were also able to start initializing some of the backend for the beta, which will give us more time to really refine these concepts as needed before our submission and find out what works well/poorly early on.
