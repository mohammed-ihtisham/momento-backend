Design Summary

Since our original proposal, our functional design submission has not changed much from our original idea. Our original idea included personal profile spaces that would be customizable to store preferences, shared memories, and similar meaningful details. Our final design includes the personal profile space with the opportunity to add notes related to an individual’s preferences (favorite colors, foods, sports, etc…). Likewise you can also add photos to include shared memories with the individual. In our original design, we also emphasized wanting to provide users with collaborative documentation spaces. In our final design version, we allow users to create occasions (events) and the owner can invite other users to be collaborators for the event. Here, users can add to-do tasks to a shared checklist emphasizing the task’s priority status and they can also share notes about the event that can be shared with all users involved with the occasion. Finally, we have implemented the suggestions recommendation engine that we originally intended in order to provide gift ideas for an occasion based on the notes that were shared with the occasion. Our major changes were related to the syncs of our app, we ended up including more syncs that we had originally planned during the first draft of our Functional Design assignment. 

We also introduced several UI/UX design refinements based on feedback we received throughout development. One of the most notable adjustments was the addition of a sidebar navigation system, which was inspired by user testing sessions where participants expressed difficulty locating core features. This change helped make navigation more intuitive and allowed users to move between views more fluidly. We further enhanced the notes experience within the personal profile by transitioning from a plain text format to a more creative post-it style layout, making entries feel more personalized and visually engaging. Additionally, instead of presenting suggestions in a temporary modal, we embedded them directly into the occasion page so they persist and can be revisited or updated over time. Lastly, we revamped the occasions page by introducing a calendar-based view that displays upcoming events alongside an event list, while also offering a card-style overview for users who prefer scanning all occasions at once. These changes allowed us to better align the interface with our goals of usability, organization, and meaningful engagement.


Reflection

Nayeemur:

I'm incredibly proud of what our team built and the process we went through to get there. This project showed me firsthand just how much coordination and iteration it takes to transform a vague idea into a working app. We started with a loose concept around gift-giving and evolved it into Momento: a shared memory holder and occasion planner. The journey wasn't easy. Erin's feedback pushed us to constantly adjust our scope and implementation, but those challenges brought our team closer together. We hit countless technical roadblocks, but we overcame them by sharing the struggle, reviewing each other's work, and dividing tasks based on our individual strengths. On a personal level, I learned how to write truly modular code and gained deep experience with syncs. I also dove into Google Cloud Storage and external bucket systems to ensure users had a reliable experience. User testing proved invaluable: it revealed blind spots we'd developed after days of staring at the same screens. In the end, we delivered something both meaningful and realistic. The process felt messy at times, but watching everything come together into a functioning product made it worth it. I learned the value of planning, feedback loops, and keeping scope in check. These are lessons I'll carry into every project moving forward.

I am very happy with what our team was able to accomplish on this project. It was great to be able to build a full-stack product that not only functions correctly but also addresses a real problem, and remains feasible within tight time constraints. One of the most valuable lessons that I took away from this project was recognizing how easy it is to become overambitious by getting excited about an idea without fully considering its usefulness or practicality. My initial suggestion of a LeetCode-style app for any subject sounded exciting, but our group hadn’t fully realized how vague and unrealistic it was for a month-long timeline. Even after pivoting based on Erin’s feedback, we were still eager to include many features, some of which could reasonably exist as separate apps. Through peer pitches and the development process, we gained a clearer sense of our oversights and what was technically feasible. The collaboration feature illustrated this well. It seemed straightforward during planning, yet once we began implementing it, we uncovered far more complexity than expected. With persistence, we were ultimately able to make it work for the final version. This was possible because of how well our team worked together. Everyone contributed across different aspects of the project, and as we neared completion, we naturally focused on our individual strengths to really polish up the final version. For instance, focused on refining the UI/UX design, as that is something I am passionate about. Although we had a difficult start and felt discouraged at times, Erin’s support motivated us to regain momentum and refine our direction. Overall, I am happy that we created something genuinely useful, an application I would actually use, while learning the importance of feedback, iteration, and realistic scoping throughout the process.

Milena:

I am very pleased with our final project. We had to overcome a lot of hurdles with our assignment submissions, but with the help of Erin and the staff we were able to delve deeper into our designs which helped speed up the whole implementation process. I am happy with the way my team was able to commit to the different deadlines in order to make sure our assignments were submitted on time. During the process of working on this project, I learned a lot about the importance of planning ahead and iteratively testing. The alpha and beta checkpoints really helped our team have a clear idea of what we wanted our demos to look like (what objectives we wanted to complete) and what features needed more work (debugging different feature implementations). Finally, user testing was very beneficial in terms of gaining input from outside sources. After thinking about this project for a month I often found myself getting lost/too consumed with our original planned idea, that I didn’t have much space left to creatively think about changes we could make to our features. The feedback from our users and Erin really helped solidify what we wanted our final project to look like and what issues could be resolved or made clearer.

AlQasem:
The experience of doing a team project at that scale was fun and enriching. It was by far the largest product I contributed to throughout my technical education. Collaborating on such a project with other team members was fun and tricky. Surprisingly, we had more disagreements on how to do the parts in the beginning more than what followed through. However, after we set a clear vision of what we want to do, the rest was just doing our best to achieve it. Working around other people’s code was less scary than I imagined. Trying to build upon each other’s design was actually fun, and made me learn from the different ways people approach projects. Overall, it was a cool experience, and I’m looking forward to presenting the results of our efforts tomorrow.
