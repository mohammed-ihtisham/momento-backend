**I like** the idea of being able to see the intersection between my schedule and others so that I have pset buddies prepared already. I would definitely use the app!
**I like** the idea of syncing in MIT’s course catalog and hydrant, it is cool and it will be helpful to reduce friction scheduling through the app

**I wish** the course catalog concept was done in a more general way that makes it more reusable. Perhaps make it into a catalog concept, and if you need specific features for a class, maybe you’ll need another specialized concept.

**I wonder** if when using the group scheduling feature, if there can be an AI-powered thing to help us add classes from the course catalog that work for both of us. Are you already doing that?
