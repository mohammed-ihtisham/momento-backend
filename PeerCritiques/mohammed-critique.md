**I like** that your project focuses on coordinating class schedules with friends, which is something every MIT student (including me) and college students in general struggle with. I really like how the scheduling page makes alignment with friends instantly visible (selected friends on top left), and I love that you can immediately see overlaps in schedules and who else is planning to take each section. The UX on the top of that page feels intuitive and directly supports how students actually try to plan classes together.

**I wish** there were an additional unique feature that really differentiates the app more clearly from existing solutions like Google Calendar or Coursicle. For example, something like automatically detecting and suggesting alternatives when a friend’s schedule changes or when a conflict arises could really reinforce the “coordinating with others” value you guys mentioned.

**I wonder** if the scheduling page might feel a bit overwhelming at first since it combines search, calendar, and detailed course info all in one space. It might be worth exploring whether some of the course-specific details could live on a separate page or collapsible panel to keep things clean, especially if this becomes the main home screen.
