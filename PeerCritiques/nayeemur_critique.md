**I like your thoughtful and ethical analysis.** The stakeholder analysis shows genuine consideration of potential harms, especially around privacy concerns with stalkers and the risk of social clustering reducing diverse peer exposure. The mitigation strategies you proposed (university email authentication, blacklisting capability) demonstrate responsible design thinking. Great work!

**I wish you were more clear on the coordination mechanism.** Your pitch describes viewing schedules and seeing similarities, but doesn't explain how students actually coordinate based on this information. When you discover a friend has Tuesday/Thursday at 11 blocked, what happens next? Do you message them? Does the app suggest alternate times? How does Course Connect help resolve that scenario better than the current process?

**I wonder about the "likely/definitely taking" feature's timing.** This addresses pre-registration uncertainty, but MIT's course selection happens on a specific timeline. When exactly would students use these tags, and how long before classes start? If everyone's tags stay in "maybe" mode until the last minute, the coordination value drops significantly. Have you thought about how to encourage early commitment or how to handle the reality that most students finalize schedules very close to the deadline?

**I wonder whether the privacy mitigations are sufficient.** You mention university email authentication, but Saturn has this and still faced privacy issues. The blacklisting feature is interesting, but what happens when someone blacklists another person in a shared group? Does it create visible social friction? Could there be a different solution?
