We have devided our app functionalities into three major sections: the relationship profiles that a user can work on individually to fill in details about loved ones, occasion planning that allows one or multiple users to organize notes and assign tasks, and the suggestion engine that is powered by AI to help give ideas for gifts and activities. We decided for our MVP to focus on the first section, creating a functional app that one user can exploit and that could be used to test the baseline fucntionalities (logging in, storing information, etc). The log-in/sign-in and the functionality of the rrlationship profiles section are working now seamlessly, and we wre currently brainstroming for the next two sections.
