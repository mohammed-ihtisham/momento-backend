# Design Summary

Since our original proposal, our functional design submission has not changed much from our original idea. Our original idea included personal profile spaces that would be customizable to store preferences, shared memories, and similar meaningful details. Our final design includes the personal profile space with the opportunity to add notes related to an individual’s preferences (favorite colors, foods, sports, etc…). Likewise you can also add photos to include shared memories with the individual. In our original design, we also emphasized wanting to provide users with collaborative documentation spaces. In our final design version, we allow users to create occasions (events) and the owner can invite other users to be collaborators for the event. Here, users can add to-do tasks to a shared checklist emphasizing the task’s priority status and they can also share notes about the event that can be shared with all users involved with the occasion. Finally, we have implemented the suggestions recommendation engine that we originally intended in order to provide gift ideas for an occasion based on the notes that were shared with the occasion. Our major changes were related to the syncs of our app, we ended up including more syncs that we had originally planned during the first draft of our Functional Design assignment.

We also introduced several UI/UX design refinements based on feedback we received throughout development. One of the most notable adjustments was the addition of a sidebar navigation system, which was inspired by user testing sessions where participants expressed difficulty locating core features. This change helped make navigation more intuitive and allowed users to move between views more fluidly. We further enhanced the notes experience within the personal profile by transitioning from a plain text format to a more creative post-it style layout, making entries feel more personalized and visually engaging. Additionally, instead of presenting suggestions in a temporary modal, we embedded them directly into the occasion page so they persist and can be revisited or updated over time. Lastly, we revamped the occasions page by introducing a calendar-based view that displays upcoming events alongside an event list, while also offering a card-style overview for users who prefer scanning all occasions at once. These changes allowed us to better align the interface with our goals of usability, organization, and meaningful engagement.
