Create the essential synchronizations for all of our concepts. You do not need an exhaustive collection of synchronizations, but should capture (a) any essential design ideas that involve multiple concepts; (b) representative syncs for kinds of sync that are common throughout your application (such as syncs for access control or notification).

EXAMPLE:

//-- Share a File (Multi-Concept Join) --//
sync ShareFileRequest
when
Requesting.request (path: "/share", session, file, shareWithUsername): (request)
where
// 1. Authenticate the requester
in Sessioning: \_getUser(session) gets requester
// 2. Authorize: requester must own the file
in FileUploading: \_getOwner(file) gets owner
requester is owner
// 3. Find the target user to share with
in UserAuthentication: \_getUserByUsername(shareWithUsername) gets targetUser
then
Sharing.shareWithUser (file, targetUser)

sync ShareFileResponse
when
Requesting.request (path: "/share"): (request)
Sharing.shareWithUser (): ()
then
Requesting.respond (request, status: "shared")

//-- Revoke Access to a File --//
sync RevokeAccessRequest
when
Requesting.request (path: "/revoke", session, file, revokeForUsername): (request)
where
in Sessioning: \_getUser(session) gets requester
in FileUploading: \_getOwner(file) gets owner
requester is owner
in UserAuthentication: \_getUserByUsername(revokeForUsername) gets targetUser
then
Sharing.revokeAccess (file, targetUser)

sync RevokeAccessResponse
when
Requesting.request (path: "/revoke"): (request)
Sharing.revokeAccess (): ()
then
Requesting.respond (request, status: "revoked")
