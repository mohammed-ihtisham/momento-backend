Progress report: how last week went, alignment to development plan

We thought last week went well. We were able to regroup as a team and solidify our application, and identify our main features and use cases. We were able to create a solid presentation approved by Erin. Unfortunately, when we did the functional design, things didn’t work out so well. Our concepts were not bad, just not modular. They weren’t separated into unique functional pieces that worked together. Features were jumbled into huge concepts and had no syncs to control them, signifying poor modular design.

We also didn’t start working on the Checkpoint: Alpha task yet because we want to make sure our concepts look good and are solidified before starting the code.

Design changes: what changes were made to the design since the last meeting

We were able to review Erin’s feedback and develop a plan for updating our concepts. We broke down everything into multiple concepts as Erin suggested, such as isolating UserAuth, Profile, Relationship, Notes, etc. We didn’t write out our new concepts yet because we want to get Erin’s feedback first from our weekly meeting. We are also a bit confused about certain aspects of the new isolated concepts implementation. We fear that if we do the preferred 6.104 modular design method to the tee, we may have an abundance of concepts. But that is something we plan to ask during our call today.

Issues: list of problems and issues to address with a sentence or two explaining each

How should we redesign our application/concepts? We’re stuck on 3 decisions:

1. App for only tracking memories (keep concepts suggested in Relationship Profile only)

2. App for planning occasions only (keep concepts suggested in OccassionPlanner only)

3. Mix:
   Our proposed plan

- UserAuth
- Profile
- Relationship
- Notes
- Occasion
- Collaboration
- TaskChecklist
- SharedNotes

Do we have to redo the whole functional design assignment? Or just update the concepts section + syncs? Our feedback was mainly to fix the concepts. You told us to resubmit by tonight. Do we resubmit the concepts section to you? Or resubmit the whole assignment?

Plans & decisions: During this meeting, we solidified our concepts with Erin in order to revise our Functional Design assignment. As a result, we have to redefine our syncs before resubmitting. With a clearer idea, we will meet as a team to rewrite the concept specs and sync together for resubmission. Additionally, we will use these revised concepts to begin implementing our project for the Alpha checkpoint. We will provide an MVP with a working frontend/backend highlighting the key interactions a user would have with our app. We will then record our project demo and revise our deadlines as a team to make sure we are on track for the beta checkpoint as well.
