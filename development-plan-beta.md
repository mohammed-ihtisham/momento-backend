We have our MVP up and running, successfully showcasing the core features of the relationship profile. After that, we began implementing the occasion-planning feature. The core structure is in place, but we decided to defer the full collaboration flow, such as inviting others to shared occasion folders, to the final version. As we explored it more deeply, we realized there were several interaction and permission complexities that would take time to get right, and since collaboration is not essential for the core purpose of the app, it made more sense to include it as a polished bonus feature in the final release rather than rush it into the beta.

Most recently, we built the suggestion engine, and its backend is functioning well. We are now exploring ways to refine and improve its frontend experience. In summary, the beta version of the app is fully functional with all major features implemented, and we are happy with where it stands. Our focus now is enhancing the frontend, making the UI more aesthetic and user-friendly, and polishing the overall UX to ensure the experience feels seamless and intuitive.
