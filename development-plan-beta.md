We have our MVP up and running, successfully showcasing the core features of the relationship profile. After that, we implemented the occasion-planning feature, choosing to use usernames for inviting people to occasion folders rather than relying on email-based notifications. Most recently, we built the suggestion engine, and its backend is functioning well; we’re now exploring ways to refine and improve its frontend experience.

In summary, the app is fully functional with all major features implemented. Our current focus is enhancing the frontend—making the UI more aesthetic and user-friendly—and improving the overall UX to ensure the experience is as seamless and intuitive as possible.
