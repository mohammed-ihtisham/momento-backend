Progress report: how last week went, alignment to development plan

We were able to complete our beta version of the app. We finalized all the design decisions and implemented the remaining concepts for occasion planning. We also made all the syncs for the occasion planning. We double-checked every storage capability and made sure we were storing everything in MongoDB.

Furthermore, we were able to get our user testing done and received a ton of feedback for how to make this app smoother in terms of design changes and functionality.

Design changes: what changes were made to the design since the last meeting

We faced many technical difficulties when trying to implement the collaborators concept. We were able to locate the problem to session management being the main issue for the collaborators' concept not working. Due to this, we decided to not release a broken/non-working version of the collaborators feature.

We’re still trying to figure out how to manage sessions in order to fix the collaborators concept, so it should be done before the final submission.

Issues: list of problems and issues to address with a sentence or two explaining each

Design Orderings. A lot of our design orderings/decisions are not intuitive for a brand-new user, as discovered by our user studies. So we will have to fix these before the final submission.

Collaborators concept is not working. The collaborators concept is facing a ton of framing and session issues that we haven’t quite figured out how to tackle. We have a few more methods to try and implement in order to get this working.

Plans & decisions: We are planning to complete implementation and test any remaining bugs.
