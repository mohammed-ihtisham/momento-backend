/**
 * The Requesting concept exposes passthrough routes by default,
 * which allow POSTs to the route:
 *
 * /{REQUESTING_BASE_URL}/{Concept name}/{action or query}
 *
 * to passthrough directly to the concept action or query.
 * This is a convenient and natural way to expose concepts to
 * the world, but should only be done intentionally for public
 * actions and queries.
 *
 * This file allows you to explicitly set inclusions and exclusions
 * for passthrough routes:
 * - inclusions: those that you can justify their inclusion
 * - exclusions: those to exclude, using Requesting routes instead
 */

 * INCLUSIONS
 *
 * Each inclusion must include a justification for why you think
 * the passthrough is appropriate (e.g. public query).
 *
 * inclusions = {"route": "justification"}

 * EXCLUSIONS
